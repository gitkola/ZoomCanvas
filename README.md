## Initial Prompt

Create React Infinite-Canvas or in other words Zoomable User Interface with 100x100 px grid. Add Toolbar with buttons 'Zoom In', 'Zoom Out', '100%' scale.

***

I'll create a zoomable infinite canvas with a 100x100px grid and control buttons. We'll use CSS transforms for zooming and panning functionality. The implementation will include:

1. A main Canvas component with zoom/pan controls  
2. A Toolbar component with zoom controls  
3. A Grid component to render the background grid

The canvas will support both mouse drag for panning and buttons/wheel for zooming.
